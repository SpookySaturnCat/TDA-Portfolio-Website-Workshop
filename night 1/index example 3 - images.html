    <!--This section is an intentional bug left in to demonstrate the issues in not using dashes
    for naming images-->

    <h2>Images CAN be tricky at times, there are properties in HTML + CSS to help</h2>
    <p>Resizing images is very useful</p>
    <img width = 25% src="images/Plusle-and-Millie.jpg" alt="A VERY cute cat and dog cuddling">
    <p>File structure is also extremely important with HTML in general. <i>Esp with images</i></p>
    <p>Let's try and change my formatting of the images name to include whitespaces</p>
    <img src="images/Plusle and Millie.jpg" alt="A VERY cute cat and dog cuddling">
    <p>Even though that is the actual name of the image, spaces and image names are not friends, use <b>-</b> instead</p>
    <h3>What if I change the directory set up?</h3>
    <p><strong>It messes up</strong></p>
    <p>We can demo that</p>
    <p>Remember to update your src and plan your structure out fully. Design before code.</p>
