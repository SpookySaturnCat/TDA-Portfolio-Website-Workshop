# TDA-Portfolio-Website-Workshop
An original interactive 3-night workshop to demonstrate how to build a simple HTML/CSS portfolio website with minimal JavaScript logic. No prior coding experience needed. This was designed for the Tech Developers Association Fall 2025 semester by Seraphina Morrison. The goal of this workshop is to be educational, productive, and encourage lower-classmen to start developing. This workshop can be taught for free by any organization as long as they do not seek to profit from it. Below is a guideline on how the workshop operates.
